April is the cruellest month, breeding<br/>
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing<br/>
Memory and desire, stirring<br/>
Dull roots with spring rain.<br/>
Winter kept us warm, covering<br/>
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding<br/>
A little life with dried tubers.<br/>
Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee<br/>
With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,<br/>
And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,<br/>
And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.<br/>
Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.<br/>
And when we were children, staying at the arch-duke’s,<br/>
My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled,<br/>
And I was frightened. He said, Marie,<br/>
Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.<br/>
In the mountains, there you feel free.<br/>
I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.
