Use Icon elements when you need to display an affordance to the user, but are too limited on space to include text.

If the Icon should be a button, make sure to include a title to enhance accessibility


The icons themselves are built from a file in this repository, `assets/icomoon/selection.json`.  You can modify this selection of icons using the [icomoon app](https://icomoon.io/)
